# Zba≈æinBar

Playground website project created to better understand ASP.NET and code from Adam Freeman's "Pro ASP.NET Core 3" book.

## Execution

Run .NET command `dotnet run` in ZbazinersBar project folder. Website will be available on localhost (by default it's port 5001).

## Food for thought:

Surely, one should adjust to team's or company's coding style. However Allman style indentation, widely used in only so few programming languages, takes way too much precious vertical space. Maybe putting opening braces on the same line isn't so weird after all?
